# Procedural-Shaders
A repository where progress of my school project is mirroring.

# Abstract
In this repository you can find different files, tips and other stuff that represents the whole work process for the Ls2 contest of the Graduates' Final Projects.

The main idea is to create a small but high-quality archiviz shader pack that won't use much memory and will be runable in modern render engines.

After having weighed all the pros and cons, Open Shading Language was chosen for the shaders implementation. I will put rendered images so you can examine the difference of the look between engines(commonly RenderMan 21.5 and BlenderCycles ver2.79 ) with the same materials applied.
